			<h2>VINYL PRINTING</h2>
			Vinyl printing on garments is an excellent alternative to traditional
			printing. This type of printing utilizes a computer and vinyl machine to
			cut your design into vinyl, and is then heat pressed onto the garment.
			<br /><br />
			Vinyl printing is best for rush jobs, same day printing, as well as
			clients wanting an alternative look to the traditional ink style methods
			of DTG and screen printing. New techniques involving gold and iridescent
			foils, as well as the highly reflective 3M material, fall under this
			category of printing.

			<h2>SCREEN PRINTING</h2>
			Screen printing is the most traditional and widely accepted as the best
			method for garment printing. Modern screen printing uses highly
			sophisticated automatic and manual presses to quickly print many shirts in
			a assembly-line process.
			<br /><br />
			A design is broken down into separate colors representing different
			screens, ink is applied, and physically pushed through the screen onto the
			garment. Screen printing is ideal for large production jobs.

			<h2>DIRECT TO GARMENT PRINTING</h2>
			Direct to Garment Printing also known as "DTG" is the most modern process
			for printing on garments. Here at BCCO we use a Kornit printer, which is
			revered as the best direct to garment printer on the market today.
			<br /><br />
			This printing method is ideal for customers looking to print photographs,
			as well as other images that have many colors. DTG is an excellent
			alternative to screen printing, as you can print as few as a couple shirts
			without all of the costs!

			<h2>HEAT TRANSFER PRINTING</h2>
			Heat transfer printing is the most cost effective printing method on the
			market today. This style utilizes high quality fabric paper which is put
			into a high density inkjet printer and then cut out and heat pressed onto
			your garment.
			<br /><br />
			Whether you're looking for a quick bachelorette shirt, or a fashion
			photographic print, heat transfer is your solution in a time crunch.
