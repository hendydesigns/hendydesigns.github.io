      <h1>Traditional Screen Printing</h1>
      <div class="service-text">
        Traditional Screen Printing is a print method that uses a plastisol ink to paint your design on a garment. A design is broken down into separate colors representing different screens. Ink is applied and physically pushed through the screen onto the garment.
        </br></br>
        This is a high quality process that is meant for designs with solid colors. The maximum amount of colors we offer for this method is 6, and it can be applied to any desired print location with the exception of going over seams.
        </br></br>
        The largest pallet we use for this method is 16x18 inches and can accommodate designs that fit within that space. 
        </br></br>
        Printing across areas, such as front-to-sleeve can not be achieved with this method. 
        </br></br>
        If a client is not using our graphic design team for art assistance, we ask that all designs be sent to us as print ready files. 
        </br></br>
        What do we mean by print ready? This means that we should have no editing or adjustments to do on our end; every detail in the provided design is to be printed. For traditional screen printing, the best format for a print ready file is an expanded Adobe Illustrator vector file. 
        </br></br>
        The minimum order for screen printing is 12 units per screen.

      <h1>Vinyl Printing</h1>
      <div class="service-text">
        Vinyl printing on garments is an excellent alternative to traditional printing. 
        </br></br>
        Fashion vinyl printing is a single color print method best used  for rush jobs, same day printing, as well as clients wanting an alternative look to the traditional ink style methods of DTG and screen printing. New techniques involving gold and iridescent foils, puff vinyl, as well as the highly reflective 3M material, fall under this category of printing.
        </br></br>
        Printable vinyl is a full color vinyl method. An inkjet printer prints designs onto a white sheet of vinyl and allows for full color designs to be applied to garments in most locations including those which can not be achieved with DTG printing. 
        </br></br>
        These types of printing utilize a computer and vinyl machine to cut your design into vinyl, and is then heat pressed onto the garment.
        </br></br>
        Printing across areas, such as front-to-sleeve can not be achieved with this method. 
        If a client is not using our graphic design team for art assistance, we ask that all designs be sent to us as print ready files. 
        </br></br>
        What do we mean by print ready? This means that we should have no editing or adjustments to do on our end; every detail in the provided design is to be printed. For fashion vinyl, the best format for a print ready file is a high resolution (at least 300 DPI) png on a transparent background, that is cropped to the edges of the design. 
        </br></br>
        For printable vinyl the best formats for a print ready file are expanded Adobe Illustrator vector files or high resolution PSD files.
        </br></br>
        There are no  minimums for vinyl printing.

      <h1>DTG</h1>
      <div class="service-text">
        Direct to garment printing is a high quality digital print method that is essentially a giant computer printer, but instead printing on paper, it prints on garments. This process is best for complex designs with lots of different color tones or fine details, such as a photograph. 
        </br></br>
        The process for DTG starts with treating the garment with a solution that helps the ink to adhere. This will sometimes leave a residue that will wash out after the first washing of the item. 
        </br></br>
        DTG uses a water based ink that absorbs into the cotton of an item. This gives the feel of the print being in the garment rather than on the garment. For this reason DTG is best suited for items with a high cotton content. 100% cotton will yield the best results. We can produce high quality prints on anything that is a minimum of 50% cotton. 
        </br></br>
        There are 4 pallet sizes that we use. All pallets have a ¼ inch no print zone around the perimeter making our maximum print sizes for each pallet ½  inch smaller than the pallet size. 
        The pallets:
        <ul>
          <li>7x8- this most often used for infant/toddler sized garments</li>
          <li>10x12- this yields the highest quality hoodie front prints, and is used for youth sized shirts</li>
          <li>14x16- This is our standard pallet for garments</li>
          <li>16x18- This is our largest pallet and it is used for oversized prints</li>
        </ul>
        This method is not meant for sleeves, hoods, pants or hats but for areas that can fit seamlessly on the pallets. Printing across areas, such as front-to-sleeve can not be achieved with this method. 
        </br></br>
        If a client is not using our graphic design team for art assistance, we ask that all designs be sent to us as print ready files. 
        </br></br>

      <h1>Embroidery</h1>
        <div class="service-text">
          Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread. Garments are placed on to a hoop compatible with the embroidery machine and a backing is used to ensure that the stitching comes out perfectly and durably.    
          </br></br>
          We offer various types of embroidery including 3D "puff" embroidery, normal embroidery, athletic "tackle twill", as well as patches of any size and design.
          </br></br>
          3D puff is a method that produces a raised effect. This is much like raised logos on baseball hats. This method is best for simple, single color designs. 
          </br></br>
          Normal embroidery is your standard stitching on garments, or flat designs for hats. 
          </br></br>
          Athletic “tackle twill”  is an extremely durable laser cut embroidery method where custom patches are sewn on to fabric. This method is perfect for Jersey-style numbers or letters, but is also customizable for any design.   
          </br></br>
          If a client is not using our graphic design team for art assistance, we ask that all designs be sent to us as print ready files.

          What do we mean by print ready? This means that we should have no editing or adjustments  to do on our end; every detail in the provided design is to be printed. For embroidery printing, the best format for a print ready file is a high resolution (at least 300 DPI) png on a transparent background, that is cropped to the edges of the design.

          There are no  minimums for embroidery.
