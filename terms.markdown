## TERMS AND CONDITIONS ##
The turnaround time on an order with BCCO NYC starts when you have paid in full and all required information has been received (i.e. finalized artwork files, approved specifications, approved samples, shipping information, etc.).    Delay in receipt of any of this information can, and likely will, result in production delays.   Our current estimated turnaround time is between five to ten business days and does not include shipping time.   Complex orders and add-ons may increase turnaround time. Delay in approval of mock ups, and additional finishing services can also result in production delays. BCCO NYC makes all efforts to ensure the mock ups created reflect all the details pertinent to a customer's order.   Customers are responsible for approving the final mock ups and confirming the details on the mock ups are accurate.  A sample is provided for viewing before production when applicable.   The sample will be part of your order.   BCCO NYC strives to produce the highest quality of work and assure customer satisfaction.


Screen coloring can vary from computer to computer which is why we use the Pantone Solid coated System to match our colors.   If you have access to them, send us the Pantone Solid Coated numbers you would like to use for your design.   This allows us to match your colors as accurately as possible.   When digitally printing items, colors may vary. We do our best to keep the color's integrity as much as possible.    We do not guarantee any color matching for DTG prints.   DTG prints can have a quarter inch margin of error due to the print pallet motion.

It is the responsibility of the customer to inquire about the different print methods
BCCO NYC offers.   BCCO NYC will do everything in their power to make sure our customers are well informed before an order is placed.   Processing an invoice with BCCO NYC serves as acknowledgment that the customer agrees to the print method identified on the mock up and/or invoice.   We highly recommend that the physical sample be viewed in person to ensure we have matched your specifications and met your quality expectations.   You are welcome to approve the sample based on the photo alone but please be advised that under no circumstances can BCCO NYC reprocess, refund, credit or replace any portion of the order if the product has not met your requirements once it has been completed and viewed.


Once an invoice is finalized and enters production, no changes can be made.   Customer provided items are accepted for printing with the understanding that BCCO NYC is not responsible for replacement of those items.   If a misprint occurs, the printing charge is credited only.   We do not print on used, soiled, or damaged provided items.  Provided items cannot be dropped off at our facility until the invoice is paid in full.  
Stock apparel provided by BCCO NYC are quality brands that come highly recommended.
You can browse clothing options by visiting the catalog found on our website.   Choices are made at the client's discretion.

If you have a deadline, it is necessary to inform us when placing your order.  A rush fee may apply if there is not enough time to complete your order within our current production schedule of 5 to 10 business days.   If you do not advise us of a due date until after your order has been paid and production has been scheduled, we may not be able to accommodate your requested due date unless "rush status" is requested, and additional charges may apply.   Any circumstances out of BCCO NYC's control (i.e. weather delays, shipping errors by the supplier, etc.) may require additional time and are not included in turn around estimates.   Same day rush order quotes are valid for 
1 hour only.   Other rush order quotes are valid until the end of the business day.  Our standard production time is 5 to 10 business days.

Slight disparities can be expected in regards to image placement.   We cannot guarantee that each image will be printed in the exact same distance from either seam or collar on every individual garment.   Each item is made by hand and variations tend to be indistinguishable.

We take great care to ensure that everything we create is of the highest quality.   All of our clients are valued customers, and we want to exceed your expectations.    In the event that you do find something wrong, we allow a 7 day window, starting from the time you receive your order, to be informed of errors and have them corrected.   We are not responsible for items that have already been sold or distributed.

BCCO NYC is not responsible for items left on our premises for more than 45 days.      After this period of time, unclaimed goods are subject to donation.   Agreement to our terms and conditions remains valid for all future transactions.
